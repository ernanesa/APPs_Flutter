## CRITICAL: AGENT & SKILL PROTOCOL (START HERE)

> **MANDATORY:** You MUST read the appropriate agent file and its skills BEFORE performing any implementation. This is the highest priority rule.

### Global Dependencies Rule
- **Always use the most up-to-date versions of libraries and SDKs**: For any code implementation or update, ALWAYS resolve dependencies to their latest major/minor versions using `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`, and handle any resulting breaking changes. Do not stick to older versions unless explicitly demanded by the user for compatibility reasons.
